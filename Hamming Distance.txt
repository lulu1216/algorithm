The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ¡Ü x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ¡ü   ¡ü

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
public class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int sum= 0;
        while(x>0||y>0){
            int a = x%2;
            int b = y%2;
            if((a^b)==1){
                sum++;
            }
            x = x>>1;
            y = y>>1;
        }
        return sum;
        
    }
}
